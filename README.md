Tachyon is self-hosted webmail: mail, contacts and calendars in one PHP
application, with no database to install. Extract one archive into a web root
and point it at your IMAP server. It speaks SMTP, Sieve, CardDAV and CalDAV,
runs behind Nextcloud or on its own, and sends nothing to anyone but your own
servers.

The whole interface loads in about 120 KB over the wire. There is no tracking,
no third party fonts or scripts, and no external avatar service.

## Features

**Mail**
- Search a whole folder subtree, using IMAP MULTISEARCH where the server has it and searching each folder in turn where it does not
- Undo send, with a configurable delay before the message reaches SMTP
- Unread count per account on the account switcher
- Remote images stay blocked until you allow them, per sender, and that list is kept on the server rather than in one browser

**Calendar**
- CalDAV, with month, week, day and list views, drag to move, and an editor for creating and changing events
- Add an invitation to a calendar straight from the message it arrived in, including files holding several events and recurring series with moved occurrences
- Import an `.ics` file into a calendar
- Several calendars per account, each with the colour and read-only state the server reports
- Recurring events expand correctly across timezones and DST, and all-day events stay date-only
- Week numbers and first day of the week are per user, as is the date format
- Syncs in the background rather than only when opened
- Off by default; enable `[calendar] enable` and point it at a server in Settings, Calendar

**Contacts**
- Groups using the standard vCard `CATEGORIES` field, so they survive a CardDAV round trip. Typing a group name while composing inserts a chip that expands to its members when the mail is sent
- Postal address, birthday, instant messaging and photo, alongside the usual fields
- Contact photos are used as avatars in the message list and message view
- Bulk operations: select a page or everything matching the current filter, and keep that selection while paging
- Writing to a selection can target To, Cc or Bcc, and suggests Bcc past a configurable threshold so a large To does not hand every address to every recipient

**Appearance**
- A light, dark and follow-the-system toggle that applies without reloading. All 16 bundled themes carry both schemes, so switching mode is a mode change rather than picking a different theme
- Vector icons throughout, drawn in the current text colour so they follow the active theme. The interface previously drew most of its icons as emoji, which ignored theming entirely
- A date picker in place of the browser's, which rendered in its own locale and ignored everything the application asked of it
- Tables in the HTML editor: insert, add and remove rows and columns

**Branding**
- Upload a login logo, separately for light and dark backgrounds, or turn it off. The built-in default takes its colour from the theme
- Upload a favicon rather than only pointing at a URL. PWA icons ship from the
  Tachyon mark, and the web manifest is still a static file, so app name, icons
  and theme colour do not yet follow custom branding
- The admin login page carries the same logo, and the login page can carry a footer

**Administration**
- Update from the admin panel when the files are writable, which is also how it declines to fight a package manager for control of the install
- Calendar, logging and branding each have their own tab
- Clear the admin TOTP secret, which is generated from a real CSPRNG
- Configurable syslog identity, so several instances on one host stay apart in the log and in a fail2ban filter
- The account you log in with can be named like any other

**Nextcloud**
- Published on the [Nextcloud App Store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/tachyon), supporting Nextcloud 26 through 35
- Migrates an existing SnappyMail install in place, reusing its data directory

**Compatibility**
- Existing SnappyMail installations upgrade in place, data directory and config unchanged
- Plugins written against the `RainLoop\` or `SnappyMail\` namespaces keep working through compatibility shims

**PHP**
- PHP 8.2 minimum, dropping 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1
- Namespaces: `RainLoop\` to `Tachyon\`, `SnappyMail\` to `Tachyon\Util\`
- PHP 8.1 enums replacing abstract constants: `ResponseType`, `StoreAction`, `MessagePriority`, `SignMeType`, `Layout`, `DkimStatus`

**Security**
- Release artifacts are signed, and the public key ships with them as `tachyon-archive-keyring.asc`
- Content-Security-Policy: fixed `report-to` with a `Reporting-Endpoints` header, `report-uri` kept as fallback
- `Permissions-Policy` denying camera, microphone, geolocation, payment and USB
- Subresource Integrity hashes for all static JS and CSS
- S/MIME signing fixed for identities whose private key has no passphrase
- Three DAV faults fixed that affected calendars and address books alike: credentials are sent with the first request rather than only after a 401, permissions are read correctly, and the connection test no longer authenticates with an encrypted copy of the password

**Build and toolchain**
- Rollup v4, ESLint v9 flat config
- GitHub Actions CI: PHP syntax check and JS/CSS lint on every push and pull request
- `gulp i18n` reports what each translation is missing and where, so contributors do not have to diff by hand
- Backup and restore produce ordinary ZIP files and download directly
- OpenPGP.js v5.11.3

## Lineage

Tachyon began as a fork of [SnappyMail](https://github.com/the-djmaze/snappymail),
which itself forked the [RainLoop Webmail Community edition](https://github.com/RainLoop/rainloop-webmail).
Both are the reason this project had somewhere to start, and a good deal of what
is listed above sits on their work.

Existing SnappyMail installations upgrade directly to Tachyon, data directory
and configuration unchanged.

### JavaScript size comparison (RainLoop 1.17 vs SnappyMail vs Tachyon)

|js/min/*         |RainLoop  |SnappyMail|  Tachyon | Tachyon gz |
|-----------------|--------: |--------: |--------: |----------: |
|admin.min.js     |  256,831 |   41,719 |   47,567 |     15,357 |
|app.min.js       |  515,367 |  202,101 |  234,162 |     78,278 |
|boot.min.js      |   84,659 |    2,231 |    2,273 |      1,295 |
|libs.min.js      |  584,772 |  110,646 |  113,032 |     40,243 |
|sieve.min.js     |        0 |   45,504 |   45,377 |     11,092 |
|calendar.min.js  |        0 |        0 |  129,224 |     41,429 |
|datepicker.min.js|        0 |        0 |   51,097 |     14,316 |
|polyfills.min.js |   32,837 |        0 |        0 |          0 |

What a browser fetches on load is `boot`, `libs` and `app`, so about 349 KB
minified or 120 KB over gzip, about 70% less than RainLoop.

Everything else is fetched only when it is needed: `sieve.min.js` when the
filters screen opens, `calendar.min.js` when the calendar does, and
`datepicker.min.js` the first time a date field is used. The calendar component
is the largest file in the project and is deliberately kept out of the initial
payload, since most installations never enable it.

### PGP

RainLoop uses OpenPGP.js v2. Tachyon (via SnappyMail lineage) uses OpenPGP.js v5 with GnuPG
and Mailvelope support. ECDSA and EdDSA key generation included.

### HTML Editor

Squire is used in place of CKEditor.

|        | normal  | min     | gzip   | min gzip |
|--------|--------:|--------:|-------:|---------:|
|squire  | 115,520 |  47,548 | 23,387 |   14,867 |
|ckeditor|       ? | 520,035 |      ? |  155,916 |

### Account-wide search

Advanced Search offers **All folders in this account**, ordered newest received
first, with the source folder shown on each result. **Include Spam and Trash**
is unchecked by default; exclusions use account folder settings and IMAP
special-use roles, including their subfolders. Searches stay within the active
account and include selectable folders even when unsubscribed.

Administrators can disable this scope with `search_all_folders = Off` in the
`[imap]` configuration section. Folder and subfolder search remain available.
The first broad search fetches date metadata for sorting; subsequent searches
reuse per-message date and attachment caches when caching is enabled. IMAP
searches still run to reflect new mail and flag changes. Any folder failure
fails the account-wide request rather than returning an apparently complete
partial result. Results are individual messages, not cross-folder threads.
